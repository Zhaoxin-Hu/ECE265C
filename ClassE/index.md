Conclusions:<br/>
1. wideband fundamental impedance for gain and efficiency
1. high-efficiency impedance at harmonics

Design Process:<br/>
1. device modeling
1. loadpull to find optimum impedance
1. design appropriate matching networks prototype considering only resistance, and then add reactance and optimize
1. realize matching network with some components or line types
1. ISM to optimize structural design, export model
1. import into ADS, simulate

Operating Conditions:<br/>
1. frequency and bandwidth
1. bias at threshold
1. use large driving power
1. supply can vary

Specs:<br/>
1. gain
1. efficiency
1. bandwidth
1. dynamic range (gain compression, and max efficiency)
